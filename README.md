# fetch

A browser based basic js fetch function that fetches User data (avatar, first_name, and email) from an open API.

Update 'https://reqres.in/api/users' in app.js with any public API.

Fire app.html up in [VSCode Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to see it in action.
